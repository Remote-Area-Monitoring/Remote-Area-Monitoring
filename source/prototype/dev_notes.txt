Painless mesh:

  - connected 3 nodes - 2 regular and 1 aggregator
  - tested node in the middle communication
      - far node out of range from aggregator
      - middle node powered on connected to aggregator
      - far node picked up connection through middle to aggregator
  - Any network topology change takes time - approx. 3 mins average
  - each node has a node id that may be used as an address to send direct messages
  - JSON variable will be useful for sensor data
  - there is a method to pass arguments to send message using lambda
      - look though examples on painlessMesh
  - Needed additional asyncTCP library - manually cloned from github - see ref links
