Painless mesh:

  - connected 3 nodes - 2 regular and 1 aggregator
  - tested node in the middle communication
      - far node out of range from aggregator
      - middle node powered on connected to aggregator
      - far node picked up connection through middle to aggregator
  - Any network topology change takes time - approx. 3 mins average
  - each node has a node id that may be used as an address to send direct messages
  - JSON variable will be useful for sensor data
  - there is a method to pass arguments to send message using lambda
      - look though examples on painlessMesh
  - Needed additional asyncTCP library - manually cloned from github - see ref links

BME280:
  - Used Adafruit library - specify the address as 0x76 in bme.begin(0x76)
  - Current: 0.45mA
  - Saw some issues where other unpowered devices would be detected / prevent
    detection of other devices
  - Pressure measured 1019.9 - actual 1020 hPa
  - Temperature measured 78F - actual ~73F
  - Humidity measured 42% - actual ~50%


Compass
  - current: 1.05mA
  - the compass reference point is the tip of the y arrow
  - azimuth = 0-360 degrees


Ultrasonic Anemometer
  - Why did we leave it?
    - when measuring the voltage on the output there is only a 700mv delta
      this difference is not much more than the noise on the signal
    - the output filters out the AC sin wave to produce a DC voltage
    - If the amplitude of the signal is larger it may let more noise through
    - Inconsistent readings


Rotary Position Sensor
  - Melexis 
  - 4.5mm max separation distance from supplied magnet to guide ring
