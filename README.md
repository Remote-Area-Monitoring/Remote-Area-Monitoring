# Remote-Area-Monitoring

# Product Overview
Remote Area Monitoring is a system designed to reduce the risk of forest fires to populated areas. Our system provides forest management personnel with a data rich view of their environment. The data is collected by a mesh network of sensing nodes and recorded to provide a history of environmental conditions. RAM provides granular insight for the areaâ€™s most at risk. Our hope is that the information gathered by our system will aid those responsible for forest management in the prevention of forest fires by prompting preventative actions.
