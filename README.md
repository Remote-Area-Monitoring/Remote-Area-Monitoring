# FAQs
## Is this a fire alarm for forests?
Yes, absolutely. One of the functions of Remote Area Monitoring is to give an early warning when fire is approaching a 
populated area. 
## What else does Remote Area Monitoring do?
We provide a historical record of the conditions in an area. As well as, real time information of the conditions during 
a fire event. This gives first responders a granular picture of what the fire is doing.
## Why is a historical record of the environment important?
When a fire breaks out, one of the important factors in predicting the outcome is the fuel load. The term fuel load 
refers to the amount and quality of the environment the fire is consuming. This is much harder to determine once the 
fire has past through an area.
## Could this data be used before a fire starts?
Yes, we strive to ensure the data gathered by Remote Area Monitoring is available to the forest management personal 
responsible for maintaining the area. This data may help them to complete controlled burns, create fire breaks and carry 
out other preventative actions.
## What happens to the network in the event of a forest fire?
The system continues to report data for as long as the nodes are active. When one node is damaged, nearby nodes may 
continue to report critical data.
## Forests are big. Is covering all that area expensive?
Remote Area Monitoring was created with people in mind. Our system is intended to protect the areas near 
civilization. We only need to create a mesh near these areas. Also, our system is designed to be modular. Not all nodes 
need the full set of sensors we offer, reducing the overall cost of the system.
